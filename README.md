# orclapex-builder-css
The application builder introduced in APEX 5.x is fantastic, but I found it a little washed out. I restored some of the 4.x colours to help distinguish page regions, plus a few other tweaks, such as moving the success message so it no longer covers key buttons.

Detail for use described on this [blog post](http://www.grassroots-oracle.com/2015/08/apex-5-colour-contrast.html). I use a browser extension to apply the attached CSS to selected websites (where APEX lives).

Built for 5.x, has worked fine since.

## Dark Mode
I will need to define a separate file for Dark Mode in APEX 19.2, there seems to be no class differences.
It has been [suggested](https://twitter.com/mikehichwa1/status/1173803917664108544) this may be addressed in 20.1
