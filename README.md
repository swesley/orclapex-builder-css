Add contrast to the Oracle APEX Application Builder

Detail for use described on this [blog post](http://www.grassroots-oracle.com/2015/08/apex-5-colour-contrast.html).

Built for 5.x, has worked fine since.

Will need to define a separate file for Dark Mode in APEX 19.2, there seems to be no class differences.
It has been [suggested](https://twitter.com/mikehichwa1/status/1173803917664108544) this may be addressed in 20.1
